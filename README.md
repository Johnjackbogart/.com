# My Personal Portfolio!!

I'm super happy to be writing code again, it is a looooott of fun

So the goal here is to create a personal portfolio site, I want a place to store projects and a place to be creative
There is so so much I want to do with this, see issues

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
